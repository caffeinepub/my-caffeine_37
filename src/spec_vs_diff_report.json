  "summary": "Diff adds a new frontend UI layer (App shell, admin/user screens, toast notifications, session-based routing) and introduces some unrelated/auth-related hooks and a backend stub. Several BuildRequest requirements are only partially evidenced, and some user-facing text constraints appear violated.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "In the admin panel, show a confirmation message after successful input/save actions across all relevant sections (including Settings updates) and show errors instead of success on error cases.",
      "reason": "The diff shows success/error toasts for many save/delete actions, but Settings rate updates appear to be persisted without any success confirmation message.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/features/admin/sections/SettingsSection.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Use English for any user-facing text newly introduced/changed by this build request.",
      "reason": "Multiple prominent UI strings are non-English (Bangla) in newly added components, and the footer includes a heart symbol as user-facing content.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-6",
      "requirement": "Add the generated static images under frontend/public/assets/generated and render them from the frontend (no backend routing).",
      "reason": "Components reference the generated image paths, but the diff summary does not provide evidence that the actual image files were added under frontend/public/assets/generated (omitted/truncated added files list).",

    {
      "description": "Added an empty backend canister actor (backend/main.mo) despite requirements being frontend-focused and no backend behavior requested.",

    {
      "description": "Introduced Internet Identity/actor plumbing (useInternetIdentity/useActor) not required by this request.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly notes third-party auth providers are non-goals and II is not required for this request; these hooks appear unrelated to the requested UI/UX, toasts, production worker names, and logout fix.",
