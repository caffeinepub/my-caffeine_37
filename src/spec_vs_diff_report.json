  "summary": "Diff implements the admin bottom nav changes (removes Settings item; enlarges buttons and adds borders). Logout functionality appears to be wired via useSession in AdminLayoutShell and UserDashboard, but the diff is truncated so UI/behavior cannot be fully verified. The incorrect time-area labels fix is not evidenced (ClockCard not modified), and an \"MT-LOAN\" label still appears in the admin header in the shown snippet.",

      "reason": "AdminLayoutShell includes logout wiring, but the diff is truncated before confirming the final header controls. Additionally, the shown snippet still renders a dashboard-only \"MT-LOAN\" header button, so it is unclear whether the requested replacement button was removed.",
