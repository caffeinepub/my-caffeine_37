  "summary": "Diff implements several UI styling changes across user dashboard components and admin settings, including distinct System Settings tab colors and a colored primary button in Worker Rate Settings. However, evidence is insufficient that all requested admin primary action buttons (especially System Settings Save/Submit actions) were updated, and several unrelated view styling changes appear added beyond the stated requirements.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Add attractive, non-gray colors to Admin panel primary action buttons (Save/Submit/Add) in Settings and Rate sections, and audit other admin sections to ensure their primary action buttons are not colorless.",
      "reason": "The diff clearly colors the Worker Rate Settings primary 'Add' button, but the System Settings Save buttons (Branding/Labels/Notice/Admin Credentials) are not shown in the truncated diff, so there is no evidence they were styled. The requirement also asks to audit other admin sections’ primary actions; the provided admin section diffs (e.g., Nasta/Payment-Loan) are truncated before showing primary buttons, so button styling cannot be verified.",
