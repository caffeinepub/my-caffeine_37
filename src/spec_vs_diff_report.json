  "summary": "The diff introduces multiple frontend code changes and a runbook document, which violates the BuildRequest constraint of making no source changes for a rebuild/redeploy retry. Additionally, there is no evidence of an actual build/deploy retry being triggered or of captured/surfaced deployment logs if failure repeats.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Retry the application build and deployment without introducing any code changes.",
      "reason": "The diff contains numerous frontend code modifications and adds a new documentation file, which are source changes rather than a no-change rebuild/redeploy retry. Also, there is no evidence in the diff of a build/deploy attempt being triggered for the current revision.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "If the deployment fails again, the build output/error logs are captured and surfaced so the next request can target a specific fix.",
      "reason": "The added runbook describes capturing logs, but there is no implementation evidence of actual log capture/surfacing (e.g., CI/CD config, scripts, or deployment tooling changes) in the provided diff summary.",

      "description": "Multiple frontend UI/auth/session/admin/user dashboard changes (registration flow, userId assignment, styling updates, component behavior updates).",
      "reason": "The request explicitly constrained the work to a rebuild/redeploy retry with no frontend/backend code changes and stated non-goals to not implement pending UI/ID fixes. These changes alter application code/behavior beyond the requested redeploy retry.",
