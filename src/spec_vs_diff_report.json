  "summary": "Most requested UI polish items are implemented (AdminLayoutShell spacing + footer restyle, KPI card readout redesign, ConfirmDialog restyle, WorkerRateSettings title/input styling, and header avatar component). However, the diff summary does not provide sufficient evidence that the Settings tabs container/card widening and Select dropdown readability fixes are actually applied within SystemSettingsSection, and the required placeholder avatar PNG asset is not shown as added under frontend/public/assets/generated.",

      "requirement": "Enlarge the main white content card under the Settings tabs and group the Settings tab buttons inside a clearer rounded, bordered container in the Settings view (AdminLayoutShell + SystemSettingsSection).",
      "reason": "AdminLayoutShell content container is widened/padded, but the diff summary for SystemSettingsSection is truncated and shows no explicit changes to TabsList/TabsTrigger container styling or a dedicated rounded/bordered tabs container. Therefore there is no clear evidence the tabs are visually grouped “inside the box” as required.",

      "reason": "CSS utility classes for admin select styling were added, but the diff summary does not show SystemSettingsSection (or other settings selects) actually using these classes on SelectTrigger/SelectContent. With SystemSettingsSection truncated, there isn’t enough evidence the dropdown readability/stacking issue is fixed in the Settings UI itself.",
