  "summary": "Admin dashboard UI changes partially implement the requested layout: the money-related buttons are grouped in a single bordered container, and the top summary area is redesigned into circular elements using aspect-square/rounded-full styling. However, the top summary circles do not clearly include the requested icon/label/value layout, and the sizing constraints (max width) may prevent the circles from spanning the full available width as required. The diff summary also indicates several unrelated authentication/session and other UI changes not requested by the BuildRequest.",

      "requirement": "Top 3 summary items should be large circular buttons spanning full available screen width with consistent spacing and clear icon/label/value layout inside each circle.",
      "reason": "AdminSummaryCards renders label + numeric value, but no icon is shown inside the circles; additionally, each circle is constrained with max-w-[140px], which may prevent the row from spanning the full available width on larger screens.",

      "reason": "These features are not part of the UI-only Admin dashboard layout requirements (REQ-1..REQ-3) and represent broader app changes beyond the request.",
