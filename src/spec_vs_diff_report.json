  "summary": "Admin Production was updated to use separate Double/Single quantities and rates with a new total formula and storage shape, and User Production History was changed to aggregate/show all workers. However, the requested increase in User Dashboard tile label font size is not clearly implemented; the ActionTile “user” label style appears small. Several unrelated authentication/registration/admin UI changes were also introduced beyond the request.",

      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Increase the font size of the four User Dashboard section tiles (Production, Snacks, Payment/Loan, Work) so the section titles are visibly larger and easier to read on mobile.",
      "reason": "The only concrete tile-label styling change shown is in ActionTile, where the “user” variant uses `text-xs`, which is not a larger font size and may be smaller than desired; no other diff evidence shows the dashboard tile labels being increased.",
