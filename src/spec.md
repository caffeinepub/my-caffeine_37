# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Restore readability and visual clarity in the user dashboard (KPI cards, action tiles, and user/friend text) and improve admin settings/button color differentiation.

**Planned changes:**
- Update User Dashboard KPI cards to increase title/body typography and slightly increase vertical sizing (padding/spacing) to match the provided screenshot reference.
- Reduce the size of the four User Dashboard action tiles (Production/Work/Nasta/Payment-Loan) by ~10% while keeping labels readable and typography balanced with the KPI section.
- Increase text sizes in user/friend-related views across the user panel to be consistent with the updated dashboard typography.
- In Admin > System Settings, apply distinct colors to each tab (Branding, Label Edit, Notice, Admin, Section) so tabs look clearly separated and the active tab state remains obvious.
- Add non-gray, cohesive theme-matching colors to primary action buttons (Save/Submit/Add) in Admin Settings and Worker Rate sections, and ensure other admin sections’ primary action buttons also use a clear colored style.

**User-visible outcome:** The user dashboard cards and user/friend sections are easier to read with larger, better-proportioned UI elements, and the admin panel has clearly color-differentiated settings tabs and visually prominent primary action buttons.
