## Summary
**Goal:** Update the Admin dashboard layout to match the provided screenshot by making the top 3 summary items large, perfectly circular buttons and visually grouping the 3 money-related buttons inside one full-width bordered container.

**Planned changes:**
- Convert the Admin dashboard top summary area (Total Work / Total Taken / Total Due) into 3 large circular buttons in a single horizontal row that spans the available screen width, with clear icon/label/value layout inside each circle.
- Ensure the top circular buttons stay perfectly round (equal width/height), with centered content, consistent border thickness, and unclipped border/shadow across common mobile widths.
- Wrap the 3 money-related grid buttons (Payment/Loan, Company Report, Final Balance) in one full-width container with a distinct border and rounded corners, while keeping each button’s existing tile styling and click behavior.
- Keep all other dashboard buttons/sections unchanged in styling and placement, and preserve existing scrolling/interaction behavior below the top summary area.

**User-visible outcome:** On the Admin dashboard, users see three large circular summary buttons across the top and a clearly bordered full-width group containing the three money-related buttons, with all values and navigation working as before.
