# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Improve the user panel UI by making the logged-in username stand out, ensuring dashboard tiles fit fully on common mobile screens, and adding a cohesive color theme to the registration form.

**Planned changes:**
- Restyle the User Dashboard header so the user name is larger and uses designer-chosen colored/gradient styling (not plain white), while still showing both “User: <id>” and the user name without overlap on mobile widths.
- Adjust the User Dashboard layout so the 2x2 action tile grid (Production, Payment/Loan, Work, Snack) and the clock card are slightly reduced in visual size and fit within the viewport without tiles overflowing outside the screen on common mobile devices.
- Restyle the RegisterView (new user registration form) with an attractive, cohesive color theme across the background/card, headings, input borders/focus states, and the primary submit button, without changing form behavior or flows.

**User-visible outcome:** Users see a more prominent, visually styled username in the dashboard header, a dashboard where the clock and action tiles fit on-screen without overflow, and a registration form that looks clearly themed and colored while behaving the same as before.
