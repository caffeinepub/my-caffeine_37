# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Redesign the User and Admin dashboard homepages to match the uploaded reference layout, emphasizing bordered/rounded grouped sections while keeping existing functionality and calculations unchanged.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the **User dashboard KPI area** so the three KPI cards (Total Due, Total Work, Total Taken) sit inside a **single shared bordered container** with rounded corners, matching the reference styling while keeping the same values/calculations.
- Update the **User dashboard action tiles layout** to match the reference: **Production / Work / Nasta** in a single row (3 columns), and **Payment/Loan** as a single tile on the next row aligned left; apply consistent rounded borders and shadows without changing navigation behavior.
- Update the **Admin dashboard KPI area** to use the same KPI layout style as the User dashboard (**1 full-width + 2 half-width**) and wrap those three KPI cards inside a **single shared bordered container**, keeping all current totals/computations.
- Reorganize the **Admin dashboard menu tiles** into visually separated, bordered/rounded groups (money-related, work-related, settings-related) while preserving existing tile destinations and not adding new screens.
- Apply consistent **outer screen/frame border** and consistent **per-group borders** across both User and Admin homepages to match the reference’s emphasis on bordered sections.

**User-visible outcome:** Both User and Admin homepages display the same bordered, grouped layout style as the reference image (shared KPI container, reorganized tiles/groups, and an outer frame border) while all existing values, calculations, and navigation work exactly as before.
